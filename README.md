Hii!! **You can call me Aly**, but I may or may not respond to _Neo Otori_ if you so choose to call me that.


I'm a **beginner in computer programming**! My main goal is to **make games as a storytelling media**, which mostly means visual novel or RPG-ish. Languages that I (somewhat) know include lua, javascript, and SQL. The main languages I want to learn right now are **Lua and Python**, since Roblox (Lua) and Renpy (Python) are the programs I want to code with the most. Right now, I'm taking the **CS50 course on edX** to learn more about Python.

While **coding is not my main passion**, it is a hobby that I enjoy indulging in every once in a while. Other interests of mine include playing video games, landscape photography, writing stories, and wrestling.
 
Nice to meet you!
